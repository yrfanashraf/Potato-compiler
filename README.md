🥔 Potato
A serious JavaScript & TypeScript playground with an unserious name

Potato is an online JavaScript & TypeScript playground built for people who just want to run code instantly without installing half the internet.

Why the name Potato?
Because it started small, simple… and then accidentally became feature-rich 🥔✨

🚀 What is Potato?

Potato lets you write, run, and share JavaScript / TypeScript code directly in your browser.

No setup.
No config files.
No “why is Node yelling at me?” moments.

Just code → run → done.

🧠 Features (aka why this potato is cracked)

⚡ Instant JS & TS execution

🔁 Switch between JavaScript & TypeScript anytime

🎨 Change editor fonts & themes (because vibes matter)

▶️ Auto-run toggle (write → see magic happen)

🔗 Share runnable code with a link

🧩 Add your own snippets

🧼 Minimal, distraction-free UI

All inside a single-page playground that refuses to overcomplicate things.

🤔 Why Potato exists

Most online compilers try to be:

an IDE

a tutorial

a cloud platform

a startup pitch

Potato just wants to help you think in code.

It’s for:

testing snippets

learning JS / TS

debugging logic

sharing quick examples

proving a point in an argument 😄

🥔 Philosophy

Less setup.
More thinking.
Zero nonsense.

Potato won’t ask for your email.
Potato won’t track your soul.
Potato won’t tell you to “upgrade to Pro”.

Potato just runs your code.

🛠 Tech (for curious humans)

JavaScript / TypeScript

In-browser code execution

Monaco-based editor

Built with performance and simplicity in mind

(Yes, it’s fast. Yes, that was intentional.)

🌱 Status

Potato is actively evolving.
New features appear when motivation + curiosity collide.

If something feels missing, it probably means:

“oh that would be cool” hasn’t happened yet.

❤️ Final note

Potato may sound silly,
but it was built with serious care, curiosity, and love for developers.

If it helps you write better code —
mission accomplished 🥔✨
